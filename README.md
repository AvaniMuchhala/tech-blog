# Tech Blog

## Description

Tech Blog is a CMS-style blog site for developers to publish their own tech-related blogs and comment on other developers' posts. This project was built so that developers have a place to learn more about technical concepts, stay up-to-date on new technologies, and share their own knowledge with the tech community. This is my first attempt at full-stack web development. While building this site, I practiced using the MVC paradigm as the architecture, Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package to authenticate users.
